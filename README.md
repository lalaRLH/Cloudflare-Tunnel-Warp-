Considering the commands issued by the Cloudflare WARP Web App during setup only work on AMD64 systemtypes - including a .sh file that will deploy the cloudflare-warp onto a RaspberryPi running Raspian x64 bit.

1. Copy file to host OS
2. Browse to where file is located using "cd"
3. Allow the .sh file to execute by running
     sudo chmod +x cloudflarefix.sh
4. Now execute by running:
     sudo ./cloudflare.sh
5. cloudflare-warp will now install
6. Resume the Cloudflare guide from Generating mdm.xml
